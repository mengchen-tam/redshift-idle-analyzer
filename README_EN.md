## üîç How It Works

### Dual Analysis Methods

This tool provides two complementary idle time analysis approaches:

#### Method 1: IO-Level Analysis (Python Script)

Analyzes CloudWatch metrics to determine cluster active state:

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| ReadIOPS | > 0 | Read I/O operations |
| WriteIOPS | > 0 | Write I/O operations |
| DatabaseConnections | > 0 | Database connection count |

**Characteristics**:
- **Sampling Interval**: Fixed 60 seconds, aligned with Redshift Serverless billing cycle
- **Detection Scope**: Includes all system-level activities (user queries, maintenance, monitoring, etc.)
- **Accuracy**: Reflects actual compute resource usage
- **Use Case**: Serverless migration cost evaluation

#### Method 2: Query-Level Analysis (SQL Script)

Analyzes user query activity based on `sys_query_history` table:

**Characteristics**:
- **Analysis Scope**: Only user SQL query activities
- **Calculation Method**: Conservative estimation based on query time span (Note: does not include detailed gap analysis between queries)
- **Data Source**: Redshift internal query history table
- **Use Case**: Understanding user query patterns and frequency

### Method Comparison

| Dimension | IO-Level Analysis | Query-Level Analysis |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Detection Target** | Resource usage | User query activity |
| **Idle Rate** | Usually lower (e.g., 86%) | Usually higher (e.g., 97%) |
| **Includes** | System maintenance, monitoring, user queries | User queries only |
| **Recommended Use** | Serverless migration decisions | Query pattern analysis |

### üìä Query-Level Analysis Features

**Accurate Calculation Method**: The current query-level analysis uses gap analysis method to provide accurate idle time calculation:

```
Calculation Logic: 
Total Idle Time = Query Gaps + Time Before First Query + Time After Last Query
Idle Percentage = (Total Idle Time / 24 hours) √ó 100%

Example Scenario: 1 query every 2 hours for 1 minute each over 24 hours
- Query gaps: 11 √ó 119 minutes = 21 hours 59 minutes
- Time before/after queries: ~2 hours
- Total idle time: ~23 hours 59 minutes
- Idle percentage: ~99.9%
```

### Cost Calculation Model

1. **Current Cost**: Based on instance type and node count on-demand pricing (dynamic API retrieval)
2. **Serverless Cost**: Active time √ó RPU hourly rate (dynamic API retrieval)
3. **Savings Calculation**: Current cost - Serverless cost

## üìã SQL Query Analysis Guide

In addition to the Python script, this tool provides SQL query scripts for query-level idle analysis:

### Usage Steps

1. **Open Redshift Query Editor**
   - Log into AWS Console
   - Navigate to Amazon Redshift service
   - Select your cluster and click "Query data"

2. **Run Analysis Query**
   ```sql
   -- Copy content from redshift_query_idle_analysis.sql and execute
   -- This query uses accurate gap analysis method to calculate idle time between queries
   ```

3. **Interpret Results**
   - **Analysis Period**: Analysis time window (24 hours)
   - **Total Queries**: Total number of queries
   - **Query Span**: Time span from first to last query
   - **Idle Percentage (Conservative)**: Conservative idle percentage estimate
   - **First/Last Query Time**: Query activity time range

### Sample Query Results

```
=== REDSHIFT QUERY-LEVEL IDLE ANALYSIS ===
Analysis Period: 24.00 hours
Total Queries: 136 queries
Successful Queries: 118 queries
Total Execution Time: 0.0768 hours
Gaps Between Queries: 0.45 hours
Time Before First Query: 9.31 hours
Time After Last Query: 13.66 hours
Total Idle Time: 23.42 hours
Idle Percentage: 97.59 %
```

### Analysis Method Comparison

| Analysis Method | Typical Idle Rate | Use Case |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **IO-Level Analysis** (Python Script) | 80-90% | Serverless migration decisions |
| **Query-Level Analysis** (SQL Script) | 95-99% | Query pattern analysis |

**Recommendation**: Use both methods together - IO-level analysis for cost evaluation, query-level analysis for understanding user activity patterns.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why does my analysis show insufficient data?
A: Possible reasons:
- Cluster was stopped during analysis period
- Cluster genuinely had no activity
- CloudWatch metric collection delay
- Insufficient permissions to retrieve certain metrics

**Solution**: Increase analysis days or check cluster status

### Q: How accurate are the cost estimates?
A: Cost estimates are based on simplified models. Actual costs may vary due to:
- AWS pricing changes
- Regional pricing differences
- Actual Serverless pricing model
- Data transfer costs
- Actual query duration, Serverless minimum billing unit is 60s

**Recommendation**: Use results as reference and conduct more detailed cost analysis

### Q: Which Redshift instance types are supported?
A: All mainstream instance types are supported:
- **Recommended RA3 instances**: ra3.large, ra3.xlplus, ra3.4xlarge, ra3.16xlarge
- DC2 instances (being deprecated): dc2.large, dc2.8xlarge
- Note: DC2 instances are being deprecated by AWS, recommend migrating to RA3 instances

### Q: Any special considerations for China regions?
A: 
- Default support for China Beijing region (cn-north-1)
- Support for China Ningxia region (cn-northwest-1)
- Uses RMB pricing based on latest AWS China region prices
- Serverless RPU calculation: 1 RPU = 4 x RA3.XLPlus, minimum 8 RPU
- Ensure using China region AWS credentials

### Q: How is Global region support?
A: **Feature Support**:
- **Theoretical Support**: This tool theoretically supports all AWS regions, including US, Europe, Asia-Pacific and other Global regions
- **Testing Verification**: Primarily tested and verified in China regions (cn-north-1, cn-northwest-1)
- **Core Functions**: 
  - **CloudWatch API**: Standard API calls, supports all regions
  - **Redshift API**: Standard API calls, supports all regions
  - **Pricing API**: Automatically selects correct API endpoint (Global regions use us-east-1)
- **Pricing Data**: 
  - **Dynamic Query**: Prioritizes AWS Pricing API for latest prices
  - **Fallback Prices**: Includes fallback price tables for major Global regions
  - **Auto Fallback**: Automatically uses fallback prices when API fails, ensuring tool availability

**Usage Recommendations**: 
- Global region users can use directly with full functionality
- Recommend testing in test environment before production use
- Tool displays price source (api/hardcoded/default), pay attention to source information
- Use cost estimation results as reference and conduct more detailed cost analysis

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors
```bash
‚ùå AWS API Error: An error occurred (AccessDenied)
```
**Solution**: Check IAM permissions, ensure necessary CloudWatch and Redshift permissions

### Cluster Not Found
```bash
‚ùå Cluster does not exist: my-cluster
```
**Solution**: Check cluster ID spelling and region settings

### Low Data Quality
```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è  Data Quality Warning: Insufficient data may affect analysis accuracy
```
**Solution**: Increase analysis days or check if cluster was running normally during analysis period
